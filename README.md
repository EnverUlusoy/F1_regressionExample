# Formula 1 Regression Analysis 🏎️

## 📌 Project Description
This project applies regression models on Formula 1 datasets to analyze the relationship between qualifying results, race performance, and other factors. The goal is to predict race outcomes and compare the accuracy of different regression techniques.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (data processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (regression models: Linear, Polynomial, etc.)  

## 📊 Objectives
- Predict race results based on qualifying and other variables  
- Analyze the statistical relationship between driver performance and race outcomes  
- Compare the performance of different regression models  

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository and run the script:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <repo-name>
python f1_regression.py
